Welcome to the frogger clone game!

To play:

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left right) to move the player across the screen.

The win:
Guide your player to the water. Once you reach the water, your player will reset to the original position.

Watch out! Don't hit any bugs while moving across the screen. If you do, your player will start over from the beginning.
